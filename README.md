## 🗒️ Note from the Developer

> This prototype's entire **functionality and working logic** was developed from scratch by me (Naga Vasuki).  
> UI/UX design was a secondary task since it was assigned to a teammate. However, I ensured all components worked properly and handled styling basics until the designer took over.
